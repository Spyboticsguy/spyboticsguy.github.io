# Welcome!
I am Tristen Allen, a Software Developer for Epic on our Caboodle (data warehouse) team. I was formerly the [Technique](http://nique.net)'s Web Developer, a member of the Georgia Tech [Student Government Association](http://sga.gatech.edu)'s IT Board, and a TA for the Georgia Tech College of Computing's introductory computer organization course, CS 2200.

I am also a musician, having played the trombone in marching, concert, and jazz bands for over a decade. I am a former member of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching Band and played the bass trombone in Tech's primary jazz ensemble. During my time at the Technique, I have also had the opportunity to write a number of news and opinion pieces, which you can find [here](http://nique.net/author/tristen-allen/).
