# Welcome!
I am Tristen Allen, a lead on Google's Core ML EngProd team.
I was formerly an engineer on [Epic](http://epic.com)'s data warehousing team,
the [Technique](http://nique.net)'s Web Developer,
and a TA for the Georgia Tech College of Computing's introductory computer organization course, CS 2200.

I am also a musician, having played the trombone in marching, concert, and jazz bands for over a decade.
I am a former member of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching Band and played the bass trombone in Tech's primary jazz ensemble.
During my time at the Technique, I have also had the opportunity to write a number of news and opinion pieces,
which you can find [here](http://nique.net/author/tristen-allen/).
All opinions are my own and do not reflect the positions of any of my current or former employers.
